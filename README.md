# ImageBirb
A simple terminal-based C++ program that manipulates 24-bit BMP images. Doesn't support other color depths because I'm lazy.

# Functionality
- Downscale 4 times
- Upscale 4 times
- Make greyscale
- Fill with average color
- Flip horizontally

# Usage
` [executable name] -i [input path] -o [output path] -[mode] `

For more info run the program with just the ` -h ` argument.
