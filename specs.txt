        ==PIXEL DATA==
Every pixel is stored using 3-byte triplets, each byte representing the relative intensity of B, G and R
Every pixel row is padded with 0s to the nearest DWORD (4B). The stride (the distance from the beginning
of one row to the beginning of the next) is calculated as:
stride = ((((biWidth * biBitCount) + 31) & ~31) >> 3)
        ==ADDITIONAL CALCULATIONS==
Get image data size by multiplying the stride by the Y resolution. Add 54 bytes for file size.
